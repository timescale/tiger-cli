- can a service be created with a vpc id attached at creation time?
- get project id from token
- is there any way to get a "whoami" answer from a token? does that even make sense?\
- can we have a "24-hour" safe delete for service deletion via mcp? The deletion should be able to be rolled back within 24 hours.
- add service start/stop/pause/resume endpoints - currently services have `paused` field and `PAUSING`/`PAUSED`/`RESUMING` status values but no API endpoints to control them
