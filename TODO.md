TODO items:
- we should get a Project ID from the API when we login (need to add a new endpoint to the API)
- need to add JWT/OATH2 support so that users don't handle API keys
- the api key stuff right now is messy. we require setting the api key from the public key and private key as public_key:private_key. should be a single string instead.
